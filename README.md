# mapbox-experiment

Experiment with mapbox gl js sdk apis.

## reference-html folder

Several versions of similar html page have been built using different mapbox features. Corresponding HTML is saved just as a reference.

- index-withMarker.html : script using Marker object to add places _on top_ of map (not in a layer)
- index-SDKlayersWithPopups.html : script that builds marker layers using SDK and shows popups
- index-SDKlayersWithOverlay.html : script that builds marker layers using SDK and shows marker info in overlay (vs popup.)

## mapbox-assets folder

The mapbox-assets folder contains files that can be used in mapbox studio to create map equivalent to index.html (in terms of layers and markers). See [README](./mapbox-assets/README.md) for steps to create markers layers.
