# mapbox-experiment

Experiment with mapbox gl js sdk apis.

index*.html files have scripts that dynamically create the map including markers and popups. 

- index-withMarkers.html : script using Marker object to add places on top of map
- index-markersWithPopups : script with markers in layers and showing popups
- index.html : script with markers in layers showing marker info in overlay

The mapbox-assets folder contains files that can be used in mapbox studio to create map equivalent to index.html (in terms of layers and markers). See [README](./mapbox-assets/README.md) for steps to create markers layers.
